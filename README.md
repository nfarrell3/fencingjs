##How does this work?

This game is a glorified rock-paper-scissors, based on the sport of fencing.

Each fencer selects a weapon. Every weapon is vulnerable to one other weapon. 

The table is thus:

1. Foil defeats Epee.

2. Epee defeats Sabre. 

3. Sabre defeats Foil.

The player controls fencer 1. The player is able to select a weapon to start the
action. The opponant (fencer 2) then has it's move selected randomly. 


If a fencer selected the weapon that defeats the opponant's weapon, the fencer 
is awarded with a point. 

If both fencers select the same weapon, a winner is selected randomly. 


The first fencer to reach five points wins the match.
